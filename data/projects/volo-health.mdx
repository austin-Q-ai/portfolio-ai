My work at TalkHealth.ai was driven by a passion for improving mental health outcomes through technology.
I was involved in backend development that helped develop a platform that provides valuable support to individuals seeking mental health assistance.
I used python and langchain and node.js. You can improve your health through talking with this ai medical bot.
This experience instilled in me a strong sense of purpose and reinforced my commitment to using technology for good.
